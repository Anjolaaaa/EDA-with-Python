# EDA-with-Python

This is a practice project of exploratory data analysis with python. 
The dataset was obtained from multiple sources, including surveys, job posting sites ,and other publicly available sources. A total of 6704 data points were collected.

The dataset includes five variables: age, experience, job role, education level and salary.

I've used the libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn ,and matplotlib for manipulation and visualization
